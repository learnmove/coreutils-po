sha384sum - compute and check SHA384 message digest

SYNOPSIS
========

**sha384sum** [*OPTION*]... [*FILE*]...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Print or check SHA384 (384-bit) checksums. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

**-b**, **--binary**
:   read in binary mode

**-c**, **--check**
:   read SHA384 sums from the FILEs and check them

**--tag**
:   create a BSD-style checksum

**-t**, **--text**
:   read in text mode (default)

The following four options are useful only when verifying checksums:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**--quiet**
:   don't print OK for each successfully verified file

**--status**
:   don't output anything, status code shows success

**--strict**
:   exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

**-w**, **--warn**
:   warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

**--help**
:   display this help and exit

**--version**
:   output version information and exit

The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2. When checking, the input should be a former output of this program. The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating input mode ('\*' for binary, space for text), and name for each FILE.
